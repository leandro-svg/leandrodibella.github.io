I'm **Leandro Di Bella**, a PhD candidate at **ETRO (VUB)** based in **Brussels, Belgium**.

My work sits at the intersection of **computer vision** and **AI for autonomous systems**, with a focus on building perception that is both high-performing and deployable.

What I work on
======
- **Autonomous perception:** detection, multi-object tracking, and vision-language models (VLMs).
- **Generative modeling for forecasting:** multi-agent motion forecasting using flow-based generative approaches.
- **Autonomous drones:** modular **multi-sensor fusion** (RGB, LiDAR, multispectral, IMU, GNSS) for navigation, localization, and robust perception.

Entrepreneurship
======
I also built and launched **Mappx**, a map-centric social travel app:
- **Mobile:** Flutter (iOS + Android)
- **Backend:** FastAPI + PostgreSQL on Azure
- **Media:** Azure Blob Storage
- **Maps:** Mapbox
- **Auth:** OAuth + email/password
- **Ops:** GitHub CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

What I'm looking for
======
I'm seeking a **full-time opportunity** where I can contribute to developing and deploying AI solutions for intelligent systems — particularly in **Belgium's research and engineering ecosystem**.
