HybridTrack is a research project focused on **robust multi-object tracking (MOT) for autonomous driving**, with an emphasis on stable and reliable tracking over time.

Core idea
======
HybridTrack combines learning-based components with a **real-time, data-driven Kalman Filter** to improve temporal stability and robustness. The goal is to get the best of both worlds: strong per-frame perception and consistent track continuity.

What I did
======
* Developed HybridTrack as a **3D vehicle tracking system** on an autonomous driving dataset.
* Designed and integrated a **data-driven Kalman Filter** for real-time tracking.
* Focused on practical robustness: reduced identity switches and improved temporal consistency.

Publication
======
Published in **IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L/ICRA)** (2025).
