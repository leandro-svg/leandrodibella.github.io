This project focuses on **deploying computer vision models on edge devices** under tight latency and compute constraints.

Embedded AI: Real-Time Instance Segmentation
======
* Implemented and optimized two instance segmentation models: **SparseInst** and **Yolov7**.
* Exported models and prepared deployment flows using **ONNX**.
* Optimized for real-time execution on **NVIDIA edge devices** with **CUDA TensorRT**.

Practical emphasis
======
* Converting research models into deployable artifacts
* Latency/throughput tuning and performance validation
* Deployment-oriented engineering (runtime, memory, and stability)
