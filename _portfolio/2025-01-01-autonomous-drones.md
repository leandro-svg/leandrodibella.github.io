This project area focuses on **autonomous navigation for drones**, where reliable perception and decision-making require robust **multi-sensor fusion** and strong **localization** under real-world constraints.

Focus
======
* **Multi-sensor fusion** for autonomous drones (RGB, LiDAR, multispectral, IMU, GNSS)
* **Localization** and state estimation as part of a deployable autonomy stack
* **Multi-agent motion forecasting** using **flow-based generative models** (for interaction-aware perception)

What I’m working on
======
* Designing modular fusion pipelines so perception, tracking, and forecasting can evolve independently.
* Fusing complementary signals across sensors to improve robustness to missing/noisy inputs.
* Improving forecasting quality in interactive scenes by modeling multi-agent dynamics.
* Building deployment-minded systems: latency-aware, stable, and testable on real platforms.
