This project area focuses on **predicting the future motion of traffic participants** (vehicles, cyclists, pedestrians) for **autonomous driving**.

Focus
======
* **Multi-agent motion forecasting** with interaction-aware modeling.
* **Generative forecasting** (e.g., flow-based / diffusion-style approaches) for multimodal futures.
* Practical emphasis: metrics, calibration, and robustness for downstream planning.
